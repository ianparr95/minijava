We believe our code-gen is working for this assignment. We didn't implement
any extra features. Completing this assignment required us to go and fix a
few precedence bugs with the parser phase of the project, but nothign major.
One thing we found especially difficult was implementing lessthan. We had a
few bugs related to it, where a sample program would run and give us NEARLY
correct data but with a few differences. We found that the bug was coming 
from the lessthan operation, where we were forgetting to push the first
argument onto the stack before evaluating the second. The other operations
already did that, but we had just forgotten to implement it on lessthan.
